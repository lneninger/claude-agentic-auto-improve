description: "Commit staged changes safely. Runs /verify-before-done first, lets the user choose which files to stage, drafts a project-style commit message (subject + Files / Verification / Contract / Status sections + Co-Authored-By trailer), and commits via HEREDOC.

Use when the user says /git-commit, 'commit this', 'make a commit', or after a feature is implementation-complete."

# /git-commit — Safe, Verified, Project-Style Commits

When invoked, run every step below in order. **Do not skip steps. Do not commit on red.** If any halt condition fires, stop and surface the failure to the user — never proceed by bypassing it.

## Context — why this skill exists

Commit hygiene is currently distributed across three places: the Bash tool's default git guidance, the project's `.githooks/pre-commit` regen automation, and the `/verify-before-done` skill. Without a single entrypoint, every commit relies on Claude remembering the rules — which means they get forgotten. This skill is the entrypoint: it ties verification, staging, secret-scan, message-drafting, and commit into one auditable flow.

The skill is **user-global** but **project-adaptive** — it reads recent `git log` output to learn the project's commit-message style instead of hardcoding one.

## Step 0: Preconditions

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree
git status --porcelain=v1 --branch
```

**Halt conditions:**
- Not inside a git work tree → tell the user and stop.
- `MERGE_HEAD`, `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD`, `REVERT_HEAD`, or `.git/rebase-merge/` exists → resolve those first with raw git, this skill does not handle mid-operation states.
- Working tree is clean (no staged, no unstaged, no untracked) → tell the user there is nothing to commit and stop.

Then read recent commits to learn the project's message style:

```bash
git log -5 --format=fuller
```

Note the structure used in this repo:
- Multi-section bodies with `## Files`, `## Verification`, `## Open follow-ups`?
- `Contract:` and `Status:` trailer lines?
- `Co-Authored-By:` trailer format?
- Subject line tone (imperative, declarative, prefixed `[area]`)?

The drafted message in Step 4 must match the style observed here. **Do not invent a format the project doesn't use.**

## Step 1: Verification gate

Invoke `/verify-before-done` via the Skill tool.

**Halt conditions:**
- Any failure reported by the verification skill → stop, surface the failure, do NOT stage or commit.
- The skill is unavailable in the current project → fall back to baseline checks based on the diff:
  - `.cs` files changed → `dotnet build --nologo --verbosity minimal`
  - `.ts`/`.html`/`.scss` under `ClientApp/` → `npm run build` in the relevant project
  - `.py` files changed → `python -m py_compile <changed files>` or the project's lint command
  - Migration files changed → confirm `ScalpingDbContextModelSnapshot.cs` (or equivalent) is also staged
- Only run baseline checks that are obviously required by the diff. Don't re-run the full suite if `/verify-before-done` ran cleanly.

## Step 2: Inventory changes

```bash
git status --porcelain
git diff --stat
git diff --cached --stat
```

Categorize and present to the user:
- **Staged** — already in the index
- **Modified** — tracked, edited, not staged
- **Added (untracked)** — new files git doesn't know about
- **Deleted** — removed but not staged

If everything is already staged and the user has explicitly indicated "just commit what's staged," skip Step 3 and go to Step 4.

## Step 3: Interactive staging

Show the modified + untracked files in a single list. Use AskUserQuestion (or a clear text prompt with file paths) to confirm which files to stage. Default selection: modified + untracked, deselected by default for any file matching the danger patterns below.

**Hard refuse to stage** (halt and ask for explicit override even if user picks them):
- `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.env`
- `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.pfx`, `*.p12`
- `id_rsa*`, `id_ed25519*`, `*.ppk`
- Files matching `*credentials*`, `*secret*`, `*password*`, `*token*` (case-insensitive) — but not files where the literal string is a normal identifier (e.g., `PasswordResetTokenEntity.cs` is fine, `tokens.json` is suspicious).

**Hard refuse to stage manually** (the pre-commit hook will regen and stage these):
- `ClientApp/**/generated/**`
- `tools/nswag/openapi.json`
- `docs/handbook/admin-panel/{architecture,contracts}/**`
- `docs/generated/openapi.json`
- Any file with the marker header `THIS FILE IS GENERATED`

For each file the user confirms, run:

```bash
git add -- <path>
```

Use `--` and quote paths with spaces. Stage explicit paths only — never `git add -A`, never `git add .`.

After staging, re-run `git diff --cached --stat` and confirm with the user that the staged set matches their intent.

## Step 4: Draft the commit message

**Subject line:**
- Imperative voice ("Add", "Fix", "Refactor"), ≤72 characters.
- Summarize the dominant change, not every file.
- No trailing period.
- If the project's recent commits use a prefix convention (`[area]`, `feat:`, `fix:`), match it. If not, don't invent one.

**Body** (include only the sections that apply, in this order):

```
<subject line>

<one-paragraph explanation of WHY this change exists — the problem it solves
or the goal it serves. 1-3 sentences. Skip for trivial commits where the
subject says everything.>

## Files

- `path/to/file.cs` — one-line role of this file in the change
- `path/to/other.ts` — ...

## Verification

- `dotnet build` — green
- `dotnet test --filter <project>` — N passed
- `/verify-before-done` — passed
- (whatever was actually run)

## Open follow-ups

- <non-blocking item the user mentioned in conversation>

Contract: .claude/concepts/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md
Status: implemented (<YYYY-MM-DD>)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Section rules:**
- `## Files` — skip entirely if ≤2 files staged. Otherwise list every staged file.
- `## Verification` — only include checks that actually ran in Step 1. Never invent verification claims.
- `## Open follow-ups` — only if the user mentioned non-blocking items in this conversation. Never fabricate.
- `Contract:` — only if a concept contract path under `.claude/concepts/` was touched, referenced in the conversation, or actively governs this change. Never invent a path.
- `Status:` — only paired with `Contract:`. Use today's date.
- `Co-Authored-By:` — **always** the last line, no blank line after, exact format `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

## Step 5: Confirm the draft

Show the full drafted message to the user. Offer three actions:
1. **Approve** → proceed to Step 6.
2. **Edit** → user provides revisions, redraft, show again.
3. **Cancel** → unstage nothing, just stop. Files remain staged for the user to commit manually.

**Never proceed to commit without explicit approval.** Silence is not approval.

## Step 6: Commit

Use a single-quoted HEREDOC so `$variable`, backticks, and `!history` inside the message stay literal:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<subject line>

<body>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

**Hard rules:**
- **Never** `--no-verify`. If a hook fails, halt, surface the error, and let the user decide what to do.
- **Never** `--amend` unless the user explicitly used the words "amend" or "fix the last commit" at the start of this skill invocation.
- **Never** sign-off bypass (`-c commit.gpgsign=false`) unless the user explicitly requested it.
- **Never** retry a hook-failed commit by stripping the failing files — fix the underlying issue.

If the pre-commit hook regenerates files (TypeScript models, OpenAPI, docs) and stages them into the in-flight commit, that is expected. Note it in Step 7.

## Step 7: Post-commit confirmation

```bash
git status
git log -1 --format=fuller
```

Report to the user:
- Subject line of the new commit + the short SHA.
- Files committed (note any pre-commit-regenerated files that were auto-added).
- Whether the working tree is now clean.
- If anything was *not* committed (e.g., user chose to leave some files unstaged), list those explicitly.

If the post-commit `git status` shows new untracked or modified files that didn't exist before the commit, that's hook output worth surfacing — the user may want a follow-up commit or may need to investigate.

## Halt-and-fix conditions (summary)

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Mid-rebase / mid-merge | Stop. User resolves manually. |
| Working tree clean | Stop. Nothing to commit. |
| `/verify-before-done` fails | Stop. Surface failure. Do not stage or commit. |
| Suspected secret in staging selection | Halt. Require explicit override or remove. |
| Generated file staged manually | Halt. Unstage; let pre-commit hook own it. |
| User declines draft | Stop. Leave files staged. |
| Pre-commit hook fails | Stop. Surface error. Never `--no-verify`. |
| User asks to amend without saying so up front | Stop. Confirm intent before amending. |

## When NOT to use this skill

- Mid-rebase, mid-merge, mid-cherry-pick → use raw git.
- Force-push, history rewrite, branch surgery → out of scope by design.
- Squash / fixup workflows → use raw `git commit --fixup` and `git rebase -i` manually.
- Pushing to remote → out of scope. The user runs `git push` themselves.

## Skill integrations

- **Always invokes** `/verify-before-done` at Step 1 (or its baseline fallback).
- **Plays well with** `/debug` and `/tdd-first` — both leave the working tree in a state this skill can commit.
- **Replaces** ad-hoc "let me commit this for you" Bash tool flows. Once this skill exists, default to it for any commit.
